          <br><br>
          I initiated the development of this
          website
          with two purposes: firstly, to establish a comprehensive database for personal and public use, and secondly,
          to
          teach myself the progress of coding such a platform.
          stimulus and evoke creativity.
          <br><br>
          Through this journey, I've gained profound
          insights,
          and my aspiration is to transparently share both my progress and the result product with you.
